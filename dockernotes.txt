													Docker(wrtten in Go)
Docker registry:
		Docker registry stores docker images.
		
Objects of Docker are Image,Container..etc.													
Image:
		An image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. Often, an image is based on another image, with some additional customization.

Container:

		A container is a runnable instance of an image.
		
		A container is defined by its image as well as any configuration options you provide to it when you create or start it. When a container is removed, any changes to its state that are not stored in persistent storage disappear.


Explaination:
		
		Image-----it is like a class in java.
		Container-----it is like creating an object to that class in java.

		You can create many object for a class.Similarly we can create many container using that one image
